Simple Multi-Threading library for Linux providing the functionality similar to kernel related wait_queues, timers, scheduling interfaces through a User Space demonstration doing simple context-switching to achieve multi-threading.

Run the test:
./demo_prog 
to see 10 counting threads in action.
You can bump it up all the way to 64 though its just a software limit that can be easily increased.
./demo_prog 60
to see the 60 counting user space threads getting scheduled
